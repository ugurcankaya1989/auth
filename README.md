# Auth Application
This application creates jwt token to control authorization when you call rest services.
  - AuthController is the provides rest services.
  - If you want to get JWT token, you can call login service and get a token. 
  - This service just produce jwt token to authorize the user.
  - Normally , we need to create user and store in the persistent DB but I did not implement this part.
